My goal with this portfolio is to evoke a sense of childlike exploration by pulling you into an interactive 3D world.

The landing page is a low-poly underwater scene, and the about page is a 3D room with interactive objects you can click on to learn about me.

The logic for the site is written in JavaScript/React/JSX, while the rendering and 3D screen creations are done with React Three Fiber/Three.js.
